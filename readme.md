# PigmenCalmer
A Spigot plugin that forces Zombie PigMen/Piglins to stop being hostile towards players after death.

### How it Works
When a player dies in the Nether, all Zombie PigMen/Piglins within a 12 chunk radius are pacified.

### Usage and Compatibility
This plugin should work on Bukkit and Spigot versions 1.16.x, although I expect this to work with some previous versions.

To install, download the latest release and place in your plugins folder, there is no configuration. 

### Testing
To verify this plugin works, go to the nether in survival, hit a Zombie PigMan/Piglin and then let them kill you.
This is a simple plugin, so if there are no errors in the console then this plugin is compatible with your version.
